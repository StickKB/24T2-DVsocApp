        <h2>Welcome to my page, I'm Nick, a first year student at UNSW and I have too many (is it ever too many?) hobbies.</h2>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I've developed a number of money sinks over the past couple of years, from mechanical keyboards to Gundams to photography. Unfortunately they're all very expensive hobbies to keep up, but I enjoy them and I think that's what matters the most. Although now that I think about it, they're not the most sociable of hobbies, but I think that sums me up pretty well.

        <h3>Pet</h3>
        <p>
            I have a cat. I adopted her a year ago from a friend impulsively, and she's called Kiki (because I like Ghibli). She's great.
