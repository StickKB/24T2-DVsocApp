                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    I've developed a number of money sinks over the past couple of years, from mechanical keyboards to Gundams to photography. Unfortunately they're all very expensive hobbies to keep up, but I enjoy them and I think that's what matters the most. Although now that I think about it, they're not the most sociable of hobbies, but I think that sums me up pretty well. I also play Valorant.

                <p>
                    I have a cat. I adopted her a year ago from a friend impulsively, and she's called Kiki (because I'm a fan of Ghibli films, my favourite is <a class = "highlight" href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle">Howl's Moving Castle</a>). She's great.
